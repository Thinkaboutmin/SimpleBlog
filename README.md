# SimpleBlog
A really simple blog made with Django.

## Blog capabilities:

It's capable of publishing articles and comment on them. That's all 
###### Isn't that what a blog is supposed to do? :)

## How it looks? 

No photos for now... Well, not really fancy I would say.

## TODO

* Configure the admin menu properly
* A few views should be revised
* Add tests for any case (too late, but still worth)
* A better url path
* Add comment reply (It will be dead simple and not complex(no fancy trees and such), ok?)
* Article with images
* Easy way to implement articles with word size and color text, images and other things.
